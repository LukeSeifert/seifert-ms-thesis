	abstract = {The C YCLUS Fuel Cycle Simulator [1] is a framework
for assessment of nuclear fuel cycle options. While C Y -
CLUS has previously been capable of system transitions
from the current fuel cycle strategy to a future option, those
transitions have never previously been driven by market
forces in the simulation. This summary describes a set
of libraries [2] that have been contibuted to the C YCLUS
framework to enable a market-driven transition analysis.
This simulation framework is incomplete without a suite
of dynamically loadable libraries representing the process
physics of the nuclear fuel cycle (i.e. mining, fuel fabri-
cation, chemical processing, transmutation, reprocessing,
etc.). Within Cycamore [3], the additional modules reposi-
tory within the C YCLUS ecosystem, provides some basic li-
braries to represent these processes. However, extension of
C YCLUS with new capabilities is community-driven, rely-
ing on contributions by user-developers. The libraries con-
tributed in this work are examples of such contributions.},

	abstract = {The effective delayed neutron fraction is an important reactor kinetics parameter. In flowing liquid-fuel reactors, this differs from the delayed neutron fraction because of the emission of delayed neutrons with a lower energy spectrum than prompt and the delayed neutron precursor (DNP) drift due to the fuel movement. In general, neglecting delayed neutron precursor drift leads to an over-estimation of the effective delayed neutron fraction. Nevertheless, the capability to simulate this peculiar phenomenon is not available in most reactor physics tools. In this project, a multi-physics approach to modeling DNP drift is developed using the GeN-Foam toolkit, and it benchmarked against available experimental data from the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). GeN-Foam couples a neutron diffusion solver with a thermal-hydraulics solver. Additionally, a new function was added for solving adjoint multi-group diffusion eigenvalue problems and calculating effective delayed neutron fraction. For benchmarking, an R-Z model of the MSRE was developed in GeN-Foam. The porous media model was applied, and cross sections were generated using the Monte Carlo code Serpent-1 with ENDF/B-VII.1 nuclear data library. In order to evaluate the impact of DNP drift, two steady-state conditions (stationary and flowing salt at 1200 gpm) were simulated. A reactivity change of -241 pcm was calculated using GeN-Foam for the MSRE between static and flowing fuel, which is in a good agreement with the experimental value of -212 pcm. The total effective delayed neutron fraction change was calculated to be -230 pcm vs. -304 pcm reported for the MSRE and analytical calculated during the experimental campaign. Three transient accidents were also analyzed.},

	abstract = {Current interest in advanced nuclear energy and molten salt reactor (MSR) concepts has enhanced interest in building the tools necessary to analyze these systems. A Python script known as ChemTriton has been developed to simulate equilibrium MSR fuel cycle performance by modeling the changing isotopic composition of an irradiated fuel salt using SCALE for neutron transport and depletion calculations. Improved capabilities in ChemTriton include a generic geometry capable of modeling multi-zone and multi-fluid systems, enhanced time-dependent feed and separations, and a critical concentration search. Although more generally applicable, the capabilities developed to date are illustrated in this paper in three applied problems: (1) simulating the startup of a thorium-based MSR fuel cycle (a likely scenario requires the first of these MSRs to be started without available 233U); (2) determining the effect of the removal of different fission products on MSR operations; and (3) obtaining the equilibrium concentration of a mixed-oxide light-water reactor fuel in a two-stage fuel cycle with a sodium fast reactor. The third problem is chosen to demonstrate versatility in an application to analyze the fuel cycle of a non-MSR system. In the first application, the initial fuel salt compositions fueled with different sources of fissile material are made feasible after (1) removing the associated nonfissile actinides after much of the This manuscript has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC under Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy.

	abstract = {Interest in circulating fuel reactors (CFRs), particularly molten salt reactors (MSRs) of the fluid fuel type, has been growing in the last two decades. Starting with a resurgence of interest in Europe, there have been a growing number of methods proposed and codes developed to model the kinetics of CFRs, which is a capability essential to the design and evaluation of such reactors. This work first reviews the physical phenomena unique to CFRs in light of current research and how CFR kinetics are impacted by these considerations. In general, it is found that the movement of delayed neutron precursors (DNPs) through the primary loop has significant impacts on transients at low reactor powers or those with significant spatial components such as a change in the primary loop mass flow rate. Effects on the neutron flux are exceedingly minimal and entirely negligible. An extensive review of published models and methods for simulating CFR kinetics is presented, along with transient simulations in fast and thermal neutron flux systems using representative codes from each of the main modeling categories. Comparisons among methods are presented as are recommendations for their use or nonuse in various transient and work-flow scenarios. In general, it is recommended that time-resolved, multigroup neutron diffusion approaches be used to establish ranges of applicability for point reactor kinetics (PRK)–based approaches that themselves may not be applicable for all modeling situations. In such cases, it is suggested that quasi-static approaches be used where PRK-based approaches cannot be used. Finally, a review of common assumptions used in these models is presented, along with an evaluation of their impact on model performance. It is found that neglecting turbulent diffusion in open core–type CFRs is a poor assumption that leads to an underestimation of the reduction of the delayed neutron fraction. Additionally, it is seen that exclusion of secondary heat transfer loops in models leads to underestimation of transient peaks and troughs.},

To further develop these MSR concepts, researchers need simulation tools for analyzing liquid-fueled MSR depletion and fuel processing. However, most contemporary nuclear reactor physics software is unable to perform high-ﬁdelity full-core depletion calculations for a reactor design with online reprocessing. This paper introduces a Python package, SaltProc, which couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT2 to simulate MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of MSR fuel salt. This work demonstrates SaltProc capabilities for a fullcore, high-ﬁdelity model of the commercial Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) concept and veriﬁes these results to results in the literature from independent, lower-ﬁdelity analyses.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, use of thorium in fast reactors has been gaining increasing attention due to its favorable features in terms of waste minimization and resource availability. In particular, use of thorium in a closed cycle leads to a limited build-up of transuranic isotopes, and to a lower radio-toxicity generation. Unfortunately, U233 breeding is always accompanied by the production of undesirable U232, which represents a serious radiological hazard to workers during fuel reprocessing and, in particular, fabrication. A possible way to partially overcome such difficulty would be to avoid fuel pin fabrication through the development of liquid-fuelled reactors, among which the most promising ones are the Molten Salt Reactors. The present paper investigates the fuel cycle performances of the reference GEN-IV Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) in terms of isotope evolution, radio-toxicity generation and safety parameters, considering different fuel cycle strategies. Main results are also compared with those obtained for the GEN-IV ELSY Lead Fast Reactor. Calculations are performed by means of the EQL3D procedure developed at the Paul Scherrer Institut (Switzerland) for the analysis of equilibrium fuel cycles in fast reactors. In order to take into account the peculiarities of the MSFR design, a modified version of the procedure is proposed and adopted to model on-line reprocessing and the presence of blankets.},
